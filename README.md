# Software Engineering Lecture

![logo](https://knda.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/Betriebe/FOM_2015_CMYK_MitWortmarke.png)

Slides & example code from the Software Engineering lecture held WS 20/21 @ [FOM University of Applied Sciences for Economics and Management Berlin](https://www.fom.de/studiengaenge/it-management/bachelor-studiengaenge/informatik/_produkte;inhalte.html)

The lecture is designed to be practical-oriented, e.g. it doesn't explain all possible UML diagram types but rather focues on few selected key topics. All explanations are accompanied by code examples. The target audience are students who are familiar with a high-level programming language such as Java or Golang.

## :mag_right: Focus

The key focus of the lecture is:

- Software Design and Modeling: UML, Design Patterns, Architecture Patterns, SOLID Principles, Modularisation
- Implementing and Integrating Real-Word Software Systems: Clean Code, Top-down vs Bottom-Up approach, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery

## :no_entry_sign: Non-Focus

Topics which are not discussed, but which will be addressed by my colleagues during the semester, are:

- Project Management
- Requirements Engineering
- Effort Estimation Techniques
- Software Testing
- Software Configurations Management
- Operating Software Systems

## :white_check_mark: Goal of the Lecture

After attending the lecture, students should be able to...

- Using UML in order to explain software systems, to capture requirements and model them out with appropriate UML types
- Understand and being able to communicate important aspects of good software designs like loose coupling, high cohesion, modularisation and clean code
- Design and implement software systems in modern environments by applying the shown architecture and design patterns
