# Software Engineering Lecture
Slides, example code from the Software Engineering lecture held WS 20/21 @ [FOM Berlin](https://www.fom.de/studiengaenge/it-management/bachelor-studiengaenge/informatik/_produkte;inhalte.html)

## Focus

The key focus of my lecture is:

- Software Design and Modeling: UML, Design Patterns, Architecture Patterns, SOLID Principles, Modularisation
- Implementing and Integrating Real-Word Software Systems: Clean Code, Top-down vs Bottom-Up approach, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery

## Non-Focus

Topics I am _not_ focusing on in my lecture, but which will be addressed by my colleagues during the semester, are:

- Project Management
- Requirements Engineering
- Software Testing
- Software Configurationsmanagement
- Operating Software Systems
- Effort Estimation Techniques

## Goal of the Lecture

After attending the lecture, students should be able to

- Using UML in order to explain software systems, to capture requirements and modell them out with appropriate UML types
- Understand and being able to communicate import aspects of good software design like loose coupling, high cohesion, modularisation and clean code techniques
- Design and implement software systems in modern environments by using the shown architecture and design patterns
